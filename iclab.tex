\subsubsection{HTTP:}
We executed HTTP GET requests from sources in both the United States and Iran to use as control and experiment results, respectively. We analyzed the differences and compiled a list of inaccessible addresses by comparing the results from Iran to the results we received in the United States. Our original tests from the U.S.  resulted in a negligible number of failures to resolve which were of the form: HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 404 Page Not Found. This occured in the case the request timed out or the domain name was intentional invalid. Invalid domains were used to test for HTTP request filtering by internet service providers (ISPs) in Iran. An invalid domain should return a 404 Page Not Found Error, however, the invlaid domains which were blocked resulted in 400 Bad Request or 403 Forbidden.\\ 

\subsubsection{Traceroute:} The traceroutes were conducted in order to pinpoint the location of the censor within Iranâ€™s network.\\
