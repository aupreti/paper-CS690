	abstract = {China’s Great Firewall passively inspects network traffic and disrupts unwanted communication by inject-ing forged DNS replies or TCP resets. We attempted to comprehensively examine the structure of the DNS in-jector, using queries from both within and outside China. Using these probes, we were able to localize the DNS monitors ’ locations, extract the firewall’s DNS black-list of approximately 15,000 keywords, and estimate the cluster structure and active response rate by utilizing an information leakage in the Great Firewall’s design. 1}
