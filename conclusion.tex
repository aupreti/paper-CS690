\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we examined censorship in Iran using two different platforms: RIPE Atlas and ICLab. We successfully  conducted DNS, HTTP, TLS and TCP measurements for a test list of over 500 domains. The results from our measurements are consistent with the findings of Halderman et al. Similar to Halderman et al., We verify deep packet inspection and HTTP host-based filtering via HTTP measurements. We observe polluted DNS responses via both ICLab and RIPE. Using RIPE Atlas, we find several inconsistencies in the DNS response depending on the resolver and the location of the resolver. In addition, we also find a larger number of errors in TLS handshake for the same test list of domains in Iran compared to the U.S.\\
A larger scale measurement can help us understand the topology of network infrastructure as well as understand methods such as HTTP filtering in a greater detail.
