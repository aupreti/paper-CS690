\section{Experiments and Results}\label{sec:experimentsandresults}
We conducted experiments using ICLab and RIPE Atlas. ICLab is a research platform used to measure global Internet censorship. ICLab was used to conduct tests targeted at over 800 domains. The domains tested fall in a variety of categories, including the  top 500 Alexa domains as accessed by people within Iran as well as several hundred additional domains, which were previously reported to be blocked. RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet reachability and connectivity.  RIPE was used determine several vantage points from which to send DNS queries.
