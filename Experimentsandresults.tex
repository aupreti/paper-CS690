\section{Experiments and Results}\label{sec:experimentsandresults}
We conducted network measurements in Iran using ICLab and RIPE Atlas.\\
ICLab is a research platform used to measure global Internet censorship. The ICLab platform consists of Raspberry Pis and VPNs as vantage points(VPs) located all around the word. This  platform allows researchers to run self-written experiments on the chosen VPs. ICLab was used to conduct tests targeting over 500 domains. The domains tested fall in a variety of categories, including the top  Alexa domains as accessed by people within Iran as well as several hundred additional domains, which were previously reported to be blocked. Figure~\ref{fig:websitelist} shows the distribution of our test domains across different categories.\\
RIPE Atlas is a global network of probes that measure Internet reachability and connectivity. RIPE was used determine several vantage points from which to send DNS queries. Next, we discuss our methods and results for each platform.
