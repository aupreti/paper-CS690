\section{Future Works}\label{sec:futureworks}
We plan to conduct a larger scale experiment to test a larger set of domains. Besides citizen lab test list, we plan to pull top 500 Alexa websites for Iran pertaining to 18 different categories as done by Halderman et al. This means we will be looking at a test list of more than 10000 domains. An interesting project for the future will be to establish a list of keywords that trigger the DPI censors in Iran. We have a method in mind that uses q binary search and a large test list of domains and sub-domains. This method will be similar to the work presented in an anonymous study of DNS-based censorship in China~\cite{anon:dns_china}.\\ Future experiments from a VP capable of traceroute measurements will help us get a better idea of network infrastructure for Iranian censorship. In addition, writing additional experiments for the ICLab tool, centinel, that are capable of taking measurements such as protocol based connection throttling is also of interest to us.
